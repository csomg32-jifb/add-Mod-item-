Hello, unknown player!
Thank you for subscribe my mod!
It's kinda hard for me to make this effect,but if you want to know how is it work:
1.set all the flag,flags save "Yes" or "No" and the time of the buff.
2.create a reward process that is cyclical.  example for a rewardlist have a reward that give its own rewardlist.
3.the after-buff effect can be able by another flag,and check the first flag,when flag is 0 or 1, it start running.
hope it will help you , you dont need to create a list with 300 reward now!
